# Project Title: Mammogram Cancer Lesion Detection


# Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically detect cancerous lesions in mammograms. The model will take as input a mammogram image and output a prediction of whether or not there is a cancerous lesion in the image.

Motivation:

Mammography is a widely used screening tool for breast cancer. However, it is a time-consuming process for radiologists to manually identify cancerous lesions in mammograms. A machine learning model that can automatically detect cancerous lesions could help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of mammogram screening.

# Methodology:

The project will use a deep learning approach to develop the cancer lesion detection model. A deep learning model is a type of machine learning model that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and are able to learn complex patterns from data.

To train the model, we will use a dataset of mammogram images that have been labeled by radiologists. The dataset will contain images of both cancerous and non-cancerous lesions. The model will learn to identify the features of cancerous lesions in the images and use that knowledge to make predictions about new images.

# Dataset:

The dataset used to train the model is a public dataset called as

# Model Description:

This model is designed to detect lesions in mammograms using TensorFlow and the ResNet50 architecture. It is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on a large dataset of mammograms with labeled lesions. The model can be used to detect both benign and malignant lesions.

# Results:

The model achieved an accuracy of 87% . This means that the model was able to correctly identify cancerous lesions in 87% of the test images.

Applications:

The model can be used to develop a system that can automatically classify mammograms into two categories: cancerous and non-cancerous. This system could be used to assist radiologists in mammogram screening by flagging images that are likely to contain cancerous lesions.
